## Description
* Research project at Graduate School of Information and Physical Science at Osaka University. This is a collaborated work with Department of Architecture for Intelligence, The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research(ISIR), Osaka University.
* This research is the approach to supervising neural networks by specifying constraints that should hold over the output space by combining complex physical model, rather than direct examples of input-output pairs.
