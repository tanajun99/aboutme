## Description
Research project at Graduate School of Information and Physical Science at Osaka University. This is a collaborated work with Department of Architecture for Intelligence, The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research(ISIR), Osaka University. This research is the approach to supervising neural networks by specifying constraints that should hold over the output space by combining complex physical model, rather than direct examples of input-output pairs.
